# Week 2

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of navigation and basic state management in a Flutter application. The app includes multiple static screens and utilizes the `setState()` method for state management.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand routing and navigation in Flutter using Navigator and named routes.
- Learn basic state management in Flutter using `setState()` and an introduction to `Provider`.

## Screens Implemented
1. **Home Screen**: The main entry point of the app with navigation buttons.
2. **Dashboard Screen**: A simple screen displaying the dashboard.
3. **Task List Screen**: A screen for displaying tasks (currently static).
4. **skill tracker screen**: coming soon

## Navigation
- The app uses named routes to navigate between screens.
